GRAPH BASICS:

A graph G = (V, E) consists of:
- V: Set of vertices (nodes)
- E: Set of edges (connections between nodes)

Types of graphs:
1. Directed Graph (Digraph): edges have direction u -> v
2. Undirected Graph: edges have no direction u - v
3. Weighted Graph: edges carry a weight (distance, cost, etc.)
4. Unweighted Graph: edges have no weight
5. Cyclic / Acyclic: cycles exist or not
6. Sparse / Dense: few edges or many edges relative to nodes

Representation of Graphs:
1. Adjacency Matrix: 2D array VxV
   - Easy to check if edge exists
   - Takes O(V^2) space
   - Best for dense graphs
2. Adjacency List: Array/List of lists
   - Each vertex stores list of neighbors
   - Takes O(V + E) space
   - Best for sparse graphs
   - Can use vector<list<int>> or list<int>* dynamically
*/

    DEPTH-FIRST SEARCH (DFS) — Recursive approach

    - DFS is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible
      along each branch before backtracking.
    - It uses recursion or an explicit stack to go deep into the graph.
    - It’s similar to preorder traversal in trees.

    Characteristics:
    - Traverses deeper before moving to next sibling node.
    - Time Complexity: O(V + E)
    - Space Complexity: O(V) for recursion stack
    - Works for both connected and disconnected graphs.
    - Commonly used in:
        - Detecting cycles
        - Topological sorting
        - Finding connected components
        - Solving path and maze problems

        // Visit all unvisited neighbors recursively

    Explanation:
    - Vertices 0–3 form the first connected component
    - Vertices 4–5 form the second connected component
    - Vertex 6 is an isolated node (third component)
    - DFS will automatically traverse all components because we loop over all vertices
      and start DFS on any vertex not yet visited.

    DFS Traversal (handling disconnected components): 0 1 2 3 4 5 6

    Explanation of DFS Traversal:
    - Starts from 0 → goes deep into 1 → 2 → 3 → then backtracks
    - Moves to 4 (since it’s unvisited) → visits 5 → backtracks
    - Moves to 6 (isolated) → visits it
    - This ensures all nodes are covered even if graph is disconnected.
