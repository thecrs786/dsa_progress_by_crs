/*******************************************************
 * PROBLEM (LeetCode 90: Subsets II) — BRIEF
 * -----------------------------------------------------
 * Given a vector<int> nums that may contain duplicates,
 * return ALL possible subsets (the power set) WITHOUT
 * DUPLICATES. The order of subsets doesn't matter.
 *
 * KEY CHALLENGE: Handling duplicate elements so that
 * logically identical subsets (e.g., [1,2] from picking
 * the first '2' vs. the second '2') appear only once.
 *
 * METHOD NAME (This file): "Include-then-Skip-Run Exclude"
 * ---------------------------------------------------------
 * - Sort nums.
 * - At index i:
 *    1) INCLUDE nums[i] -> recurse i+1
 *    2) BACKTRACK (pop the include)
 *    3) EXCLUDE the entire run of duplicates starting at i+1
 *       (i.e., jump idx forward over all equal nums[idx]==nums[idx-1])
 *       -> recurse from the first index after that run.
 *
 * WHY THIS WORKS :
 * - When you exclude nums[i], you MUST also skip all of its
 *   identical twins at this recursion depth; otherwise, you
 *   can pick an indistinguishable twin later and produce a
 *   duplicate subset (same multiset content).
 *
 * TIME COMPLEXITY :
 * - O(n log n) for sort + O(n * 2^n) to generate/copy subsets.
 *   (Each subset copy costs up to O(n), total subsets ≤ 2^n.)
 *
 * SPACE COMPLEXITY :
 * - O(n) recursion depth + O(total output) to store answers.
 *
 * OPTIMALITY :
 * - Enumerating all unique subsets is Θ(#answers). You cannot
 *   asymptotically beat O(#answers). This solution is optimal.
 *
 * LEETCODE FEASIBILITY (No BS):
 * - LeetCode 90 typically has n ≤ 10. This solution is easily
 *   accepted. No TLE, no MLE. If n were ~20–25, still fine.
 *
 * WHY NOT "exclude->recurse, then include->recurse WITHOUT pop"?
 * --------------------------------------------------------------
 * 1) Backtracking requires restoring shared mutable state (vector).
 *    If you push and don't pop, the parent's state is polluted.
 * 2) Even with correct pops, excluding a value and then allowing
 *    its twin at the SAME depth produces duplicates. You must
 *    SKIP the entire run after an exclude at that depth.
 *
 * HOW DUPLICATES FORM (Intuition)
 * --------------------------------
 * Example: nums = [1,2,2] (sorted)
 *
 * Naive recursion (no skipping):
 *                 (start)
 *               /         \
 *           pick 1       skip 1
 *            /  \          /  \
 *        pick 2 skip 2  pick 2 skip 2
 *         / \    / \     / \    / \
 *       p2 s2  p2 s2   p2 s2  p2 s2
 *
 * Focus on producing subset [1,2]:
 * - pick 1, pick first 2, skip second 2 -> [1,2]
 * - pick 1, skip first 2, pick second 2 -> [1,2]  (DUPLICATE!)
 *
 * Both 2's are indistinguishable. To avoid this, when we choose to
 * EXCLUDE the first '2' at this depth, we must SKIP all subsequent
 * 2's at the SAME depth. That’s exactly what the idx-jump does.
 *
 * ASCII TREE (showing the SKIP after EXCLUDE):
 *
 * Suppose nums = [1, 2, 2, 2, 3]
 *
 * At i pointing to the first '2' (say i=1):
 *   INCLUDE path explores counts of 2's:
 *       include 2 at i=1 -> (i=2)
 *           include next 2 -> (i=3)
 *               include next 2 -> (i=4) -> ...
 *           ... (also tries partial counts)
 *
 *   EXCLUDE path must jump over the entire '2'-run:
 *       i=1 exclude -> idx jumps to first non-2 (idx=4 where nums[4]=3)
 *       recurse from idx=4, i.e., we never start a subset that first
 *       includes a later '2' after having excluded the earlier '2' at
 *       the SAME decision level — preventing duplicates like:
 *         (include second 2 / exclude first 2) vs
 *         (include first 2 / exclude second 2)
 *
 * POP_BACK IS NON-NEGOTIABLE (STATE RESTORE):
 * -------------------------------------------
 * We pass 'ans' by reference for performance. Each choice mutates it.
 * After returning from a branch where we pushed, we MUST pop to restore
 * the exact state the sibling branch expects. Otherwise, pollutants
 * leak into siblings and the whole tree is wrong.

/**************************************************************
 * DETAILED STEP-BY-STEP (WHY EACH STEP EXISTS)
 * --------------------------------------------
 * 1) sort(nums):
 *    - Groups equal values contiguously. Essential so that when we
 *      exclude nums[i], we can jump over the entire run of identicals.
 *
 * 2) ans.push_back(nums[i]) -> recurse(i+1) -> ans.pop_back():
 *    - INCLUDE branch: we try taking the current number.
 *    - After recursion returns, we MUST restore 'ans' via pop_back()
 *      so the EXCLUDE branch sees the clean pre-include state.
 *
 * 3) idx = i+1; while (idx < n && nums[idx] == nums[idx-1]) idx++;
 *    - EXCLUDE branch with SKIP : having decided to exclude nums[i],
 *      we now skip all its identical twins at the SAME depth to avoid
 *      generating indistinguishable subsets later.
 *      Example: [1,2,2] — exclude first 2, then if we allow starting with
 *      second 2 at this depth, we’ll recreate every subset that starts with a 2.
 *
 * 4) Recurse from idx after skipping run:
 *    - Now we move to the next different value and continue branching.
 *
 * WHY WE MUST NOT INCLUDE THE "SAME ELEMENT" AFTER EXCLUDING IT ONCE
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------
 * "Same element" here means "same value at the same recursion depth".
 * If you exclude nums[i] = 2 and then, still at this depth, include
 * nums[i+1] = 2, you create subsets that are indistinguishable from
 * those created by including nums[i] and excluding nums[i+1].
 * Since 2’s are identical, the subset contents are identical — duplicates.
 *
 * Concrete duplicate for nums = [1,2,2]:
 * - Path A : include 2 at i=1, exclude 2 at i=2 -> subset [1,2]
 * - Path B : exclude 2 at i=1, include 2 at i=2 -> subset [1,2] (duplicate)
 * The "skip run after exclude" forbids Path B at that depth.
 *
 * ALTERNATIVE PATTERNS (FYI)
 * --------------------------
 * 1) Depth-For-Loop pattern:
 *    - At each level, iterate j from i..n-1, but skip j>i if nums[j]==nums[j-1].
 *    - Also standard and accepted. Same complexity.
 *
 * 2) Counting runs:
 *    - For a run of value v with frequency f, choose k=0..f copies and recurse.
 *    - Also valid and often clean.
 *
 * Bottom line: You cannot avoid the "skip duplicates at the same depth" rule.
 *
 * EDGE CASES & KEY INSIGHTS
 * -------------------------
 * - Empty input -> one subset: [].
 * - All duplicates, e.g., [2,2,2,2] -> f=4 -> (4+1)=5 subsets: choose 0..4 copies.
 * - Negative numbers? Works. Sorting handles order; equality works the same.
 * - Large n? Enumeration is exponential by nature. On LeetCode constraints,
 *   this is comfortably accepted.
