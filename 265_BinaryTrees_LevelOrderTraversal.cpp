    LOGIC BEHIND USING NULL:

    ✔ Once we reach NULL, we know it's time to print a new line and separate levels.
    ✔ It prevents the need for counting nodes or tracking levels separately.

========================
EXPLANATION
========================
✔ This code demonstrates Level Order Traversal (BFS) using a queue with explicit level separation.
✔ It traverses the binary tree breadth-first, printing nodes level by level.

✔ How it works:
1. We push the root node into the queue to start.
2. We use a NULL marker to indicate the end of a level.
3. While the queue is not empty:
   - We process nodes one by one.
   - If the node is not NULL:
     ✔ We print its value.
     ✔ We enqueue its left and right children if they exist.
   - If the node is NULL:
     ✔ We print a newline to mark the end of the level.
     ✔ We enqueue another NULL marker if more nodes remain to be processed.

✔ This approach is simple, intuitive, and avoids complex bookkeeping.

========================
EXAMPLE
========================
Given preorder sequence:
1, 2, -1, -1, 3, 4, -1, -1, 5, -1, -1

The tree built is:

       1
      / \
     2   3
        / \
       4   5

Output:
Level Order Traversal Output:
1 
2 3 
4 5 

✔ Nodes are printed level by level with separation between levels.

========================
IMPORTANT DETAILS
========================
✔ The queue ensures FIFO order, crucial for BFS.
✔ NULL markers help distinguish levels without extra counters or structures.
✔ Efficient traversal without recursion makes it suitable for large trees.

========================
WHY USE NULL MARKERS?
========================
✔ NULL markers allow us to easily separate levels during traversal.
✔ They make output formatting simple and prevent tracking multiple variables.
✔ They're particularly useful when we need to process or analyze tree levels.

========================
INLINE COMMENTS ON NULL AND LINE MAINTAINING
========================
✔ NULL is pushed after the root to separate levels visually.
✔ When we encounter NULL during processing, it signals the end of a level.
✔ We print a newline and, if nodes are pending, add another NULL to continue.
✔ This ensures that each level is printed clearly and intuitively.

========================
EDGE CASE HANDLING
========================
✔ If the tree is empty (root == NULL), the function immediately exits.
✔ The traversal stops once all nodes are processed and no further NULL markers are needed.

========================
SIMILAR QUESTIONS AND USE CASES
========================
✔ Check completeness or balance of binary trees.
✔ Find the maximum width or depth of the tree.
✔ Serialize and deserialize trees using BFS.
✔ Solve graph traversal problems like shortest path.

========================
PRACTICE TIP
========================
✔ Practice manually tracing the queue’s state for small trees.
✔ Try modifying the traversal to print nodes in zigzag or spiral order.
✔ Compare BFS with DFS to understand their different use cases.
