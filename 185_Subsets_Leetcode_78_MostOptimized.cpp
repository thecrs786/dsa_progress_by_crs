    ✅ LEETCODE 78. SUBSETS
    ---------------------------------
    🎯 PROBLEM BRIEF:
    - Given a vector `nums` of distinct integers, return all possible subsets (the power set).
    - A subset can be empty or contain any number of elements.
    - The order of subsets does not matter.

    Example:
      Input: nums = [1,2,3]
      Output: [[], [1], [2], [3], [1,2], [1,3], [2,3], [1,2,3]]

    ---------------------------------
    📌 SOLUTION NAME:
    Backtracking (Recursive Approach)

    ---------------------------------
    ⏱️ TIME COMPLEXITY:
    - There are 2^n subsets for n elements.
    - Each subset can take O(n) to copy into `allsubsets`.
    - Total = O(2^n * n).

    💾 SPACE COMPLEXITY:
    - O(2^n * n) for storing all subsets.
    - O(n) recursion depth for the call stack.
    - Overall: O(2^n * n).

    ---------------------------------
    ⚡ OPTIMALITY:
    - This is the most optimal solution for generating all subsets.
    - You cannot do better than O(2^n * n), since the output itself is that large.
    - This solution is fully accepted by LeetCode.
    - No risk of TLE/MLE for constraints (n ≤ 10–20 on LeetCode).

    ---------------------------------
    🔑 KEY INSIGHTS:
    1. At each index `i`, we have 2 choices:
       - INCLUDE nums[i]
       - EXCLUDE nums[i]
       This binary decision tree generates all 2^n subsets.
    
    2. Why `allsubsets.push_back(ans)` works:
       - `ans` is a vector representing the current subset (partial path).
       - At base case, when `i == nums.size()`, we have a *complete* subset.
       - `push_back(ans)` makes a **copy** of `ans` and stores it into `allsubsets`.
       - Without copy, we’d lose subsets when `ans` changes (due to backtracking).
       - `{ans}` is redundant, `push_back(ans)` is enough.

    3. Backtracking ensures we “undo” the include step before exploring the exclude path.
       - This is why `ans.pop_back()` is essential.

    ---------------------------------
    🚀 FUNCTION LOGIC (Step by Step):
    getallsubsets(nums, ans, allsubsets, i):
    - Base Case:
        If i == nums.size():
            → All decisions made, subset `ans` is complete.
            → Store it in allsubsets using push_back(ans).
            → Return to backtrack.
    - Recursive Case:
        1. INCLUDE nums[i]:
            → ans.push_back(nums[i])
            → Recurse with i+1
        2. BACKTRACK:
            → ans.pop_back() to undo
        3. EXCLUDE nums[i]:
            → Recurse with i+1 (without adding nums[i])

    🧠 WORKING EXAMPLE: nums = [1,2]
    
    Call Tree:
    
    getallsubsets(nums, [], allsubsets, 0)
      → INCLUDE 1
        getallsubsets(nums, [1], allsubsets, 1)
          → INCLUDE 2
            getallsubsets(nums, [1,2], allsubsets, 2) 
              → Base case → store [1,2]
          → BACKTRACK (remove 2)
          → EXCLUDE 2
            getallsubsets(nums, [1], allsubsets, 2)
              → Base case → store [1]
      → BACKTRACK (remove 1)
      → EXCLUDE 1
        getallsubsets(nums, [], allsubsets, 1)
          → INCLUDE 2
            getallsubsets(nums, [2], allsubsets, 2)
              → Base case → store [2]
          → BACKTRACK (remove 2)
          → EXCLUDE 2
            getallsubsets(nums, [], allsubsets, 2)
              → Base case → store []
    
    Final allsubsets = [[1,2], [1], [2], []]

    ---------------------------------
    🔑 KEY DETAIL ABOUT STORAGE:
    - At base case, we do allsubsets.push_back(ans).
    - ans is passed by reference, BUT push_back copies it.
    - Example:
        If ans = [1,2] at base case, 
        push_back stores a snapshot [1,2].
        Later backtracking removes 2 → ans=[1], 
        but the snapshot [1,2] remains in allsubsets.
    - This is how we safely collect all subsets.
