    LeetCode 819 - Most Common Word
    -----------------------------------------------------------

    QUESTION (BRIEF):
    - Given a paragraph (string) and a list of banned words (vector<string>),
      find the most frequent word in the paragraph that is NOT in the banned list.
    - Words are case-insensitive and consist only of letters/numbers.
    - Punctuation should be ignored.

    SOLUTION METHOD:
    - Approach: Hashing with `unordered_set` for banned words and `unordered_map` for frequency counting.
    - Steps:
        1. Store banned words in an `unordered_set` for O(1) lookup.
        2. Iterate through the paragraph character-by-character, building words.
        3. Normalize to lowercase while building.
        4. When a word is complete, check if it is NOT banned → increment its count in the map.
        5. After processing, find the word with maximum frequency.

    COMPLEXITY:
    - Time Complexity: O(n + b) where:
        n = length of paragraph
        b = size of banned list
    - Space Complexity: O(k + b) where:
        k = number of unique non-banned words
        b = number of banned words

    OPTIMALITY:
    - YES, this is the most optimal solution possible for the problem.
    - Both parsing and counting are done in a single pass (O(n)).
    - Lookup operations are O(1) on average due to hashing.

    LEETCODE ACCEPTANCE:
    - Will PASS without TLE (Time Limit Exceeded) or MLE (Memory Limit Exceeded).
    - Efficient for constraints given in the problem.

    IMPORTANT DETAILS:
    - `unordered_set` is used to store banned words for fast lookup.
    - `unordered_map` stores word → frequency mapping.
    - `m[word]++` works even if `word` does not exist yet because:
        * If `word` is not in the map, `unordered_map` default-constructs its value (0 for int),
          then increments it to 1.
    - Case normalization is important (all to lowercase).
    - `isalnum()` is used to detect valid word characters.

    ------------------------------
    STEP-BY-STEP FUNCTION EXPLANATION
    ------------------------------
    1. Convert banned words to `unordered_set` b:
       - Allows O(1) lookup to check if a word is banned.
    2. Use `unordered_map` m to store frequency counts of words.
    3. Loop through paragraph character-by-character:
       - If char is alphanumeric → add lowercase version to current word.
       - If not → means word ended, so process it.
    4. Skip empty words and banned words.
    5. Increment count in map: `m[word]++` automatically creates entry if missing (starts at 0).
    6. After all words are processed → iterate over map to find max frequency word.
    7. Return that word.

    ------------------------------
    LOGIC / WORKING
    ------------------------------
    The key trick is hashing:
    - Banned words: `unordered_set` for O(1) check → no linear search needed.
    - Word frequency: `unordered_map` for O(1) insert/update.
    Parsing is done in a single pass → O(n) time.

    ------------------------------
    KEY INSIGHTS
    ------------------------------
    - Why unordered_set for banned words?
        Faster lookup (avg O(1)) vs. O(log n) for set or O(n) for vector.
    - Why unordered_map for frequencies?
        We need fast insert + update for each word.
    - How does m[word]++ work if key doesn't exist?
        The `operator[]` on unordered_map:
            1. Checks if key exists.
            2. If not → inserts it with default value (0 for int).
            3. Returns reference to value.
            4. The ++ increments from 0 to 1.
    - isalnum() ensures punctuation and spaces are skipped.
    - tolower() ensures case insensitivity.
