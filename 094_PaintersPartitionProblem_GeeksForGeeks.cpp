/*
    Painter's Partition Problem  (Same as Book Allocation Problem)

    Problem:
    Given N boards with lengths stored in an array,
    and M painters — each takes 1 unit time to paint 1 unit of board length.

    Goal:
    Allocate contiguous boards to each painter such that the time
    to paint all boards is minimized.

    Constraint:
    - Each painter must paint at least one board
    - Boards assigned must be contiguous
