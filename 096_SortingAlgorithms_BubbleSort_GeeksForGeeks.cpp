/*  LOOP LOGIC :

Why  n-1  Iterations in the Outer Loop:
In Bubble Sort, we need a maximum of n-1 passes (where n is the number of elements) to fully sort the array.
This is because, in each pass, the largest unsorted element "bubbles up" to its correct position at the end of the array by repeated swapping.
After the first pass, the largest element is sorted and placed at the last index.
After the second pass, the second-largest is placed at the second-last index, and so on.
So, after n-1 such passes, all elements are in their correct position—hence the outer loop runs n-1 times.

 Why  n-i-1  Iterations in the Inner Loop:
In each outer loop iteration i, the last i elements are already sorted and in their correct positions.
So there’s no need to compare or swap them again in the current pass.
Therefore, the inner loop only needs to run up to index n-i-2, which means n-i-1 comparisons/swaps are done.
This reduces the search space with each pass, making the algorithm more efficient.
