// Destructor : Opposite of Constructor
// It is a special member function of a class that deallocates memory
// It is called automatically when an object goes out of scope or is deleted
// // BUT it does NOT automatically deallocate dynamically allocated memory
// For dynamically allocated memory, we must define our own destructor to free it
// when we use 'new' to allocate memory, we must use 'delete' to free it since it's dynamically allocated

// Syntax: ~ClassName(){ // code to free memory or other cleanup tasks }
// Destructor has the same name as the class but with a tilde (~) prefix
// It does not take any parameters and does not return any value
