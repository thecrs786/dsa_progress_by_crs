/*
LeetCode Problem 94 - Binary Tree Inorder Traversal

Question (in brief):
Given the root of a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.
Inorder means visiting nodes in the order: left subtree → current node → right subtree.

Example 1:
Input: root = [1,null,2,3]
Output: [1,3,2]
Explanation: We traverse left, root, then right.

Example 2:
Input: root = []
Output: []
Explanation: Empty tree means no nodes to traverse.

Example 3:
Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]
Explanation: Single node tree, traversal is itself.

Approach Used:
- Morris Traversal (Inorder traversal with O(1) extra space)
- Uses temporary threading to avoid recursion or stack.
- Restores tree structure after traversal.

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes. Each node is visited at most twice.
Space Complexity: O(1), ignoring the output vector. No recursion stack or explicit stack is used.

Most Optimal?: 
✔ Yes, this is the most space-efficient approach for inorder traversal.
✘ More complex and error-prone than recursive or iterative stack-based approaches.

Accepted by LeetCode?: 
✔ Yes, passes all test cases including very deep trees without causing MLE or TLE.

Warnings:
⚠ Careful pointer manipulation is required; missing thread restoration will corrupt the tree.
⚠ Debugging is harder due to in-place modification and pointer logic.

Key Insights:
✔ Morris traversal uses temporary "threads" to keep track of parent nodes.
✔ Threads are only created where safe — rightmost node’s right pointer is NULL.
✔ Threads are restored to NULL after use, ensuring tree remains unchanged.
✔ Avoids recursion stack, thus preventing stack overflow.

/*
LOGIC AND EXPLANATION (Detailed and understandable):

1. Inorder traversal means visiting nodes in the order: left subtree → node → right subtree.

2. The challenge is to do this without using recursion or extra stack space.

3. We use the concept of "threading":
   - Find the inorder predecessor (IP) → the rightmost node in the left subtree.
   - Temporarily link its right pointer to the current node (threading).
   - This helps us come back to the current node after processing the left subtree.

4. There are two cases in each iteration:

   CASE 1 → If curr->left is NULL:
     - There is no left subtree to process.
     - We can safely visit the current node and move to its right child.

   CASE 2 → If curr->left is not NULL:
     - Find IP → rightmost node in left subtree.
     - Check if IP’s right is NULL:
         → Create a temporary thread → IP->right = curr
         → Move left → curr = curr->left
     - Else (IP’s right == curr):
         → The thread already exists → remove it
         → Visit curr → ans.push_back(curr->val)
         → Move to the right subtree → curr = curr->right

5. This guarantees that every node is visited exactly once for processing, and at most twice for threading and unthreading.

6. Why no risk of losing the original tree?
   - We only create threads when IP->right is NULL → safe to modify.
   - Before visiting the current node after left traversal, we remove the thread → restoring tree structure.

7. Why does this guarantee full traversal?
   - Every node is either processed immediately (if no left child) or after exploring its left subtree through threading.
   - We eventually explore all leftmost paths before visiting nodes and their right children.

8. What is a thread and why create it?
   - Thread = temporary connection from the inorder predecessor back to the current node.
   - It simulates the stack return pointer that recursion would otherwise use.

9. Connections we are making:
   - We temporarily link IP->right → curr to revisit after left traversal.

10. By carefully creating and deleting threads, we ensure:
    ✔ Safe traversal
    ✔ No extra space
    ✔ Tree structure restored after traversal

IMPORTANT DETAILS, WARNINGS, AND KEY INSIGHTS:

✔ Threading is a temporary mechanism that helps simulate recursion using O(1) space.
✔ We only create threads where safe → at rightmost nodes with NULL pointers.
✔ Always check if the thread already exists before deleting it to avoid breaking the tree.
✔ After traversal, the tree structure is exactly as before → threads are removed.
✔ Understanding inorder predecessor is key to grasping Morris traversal.
✔ The algorithm guarantees every node is processed without missing or repeating any.

⚠ Warnings:
- Incorrect pointer manipulation will corrupt the tree or cause infinite loops.
- Debugging is harder because of temporary threads — thorough walkthroughs help.
- This approach is advanced and should be practiced multiple times before using in production.

✔ Key Insights:
- Space optimization doesn’t have to compromise correctness if we carefully manage temporary state.
- Morris traversal is a brilliant application of tree properties and recursion simulation.
- It's an excellent problem to understand how pointers and data structures work together.
