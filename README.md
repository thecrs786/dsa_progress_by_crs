# DSA Progress by CRS

This repository contains my C++ DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) practice files. Each file includes explanations, examples, and LeetCode problem solutions.

## Repository Structure
- `000_LeetcodeSkippedQuestions.cpp` → List of skipped problems
- `001_Output.cpp` → Output examples
- `002_DataTypes.cpp` → Data types in C++
- `003_Typecasting.cpp` → Typecasting in C++
- …and so on for all practice files

## Notes
- Files include step-by-step explanations for clarity.
- LeetCode solutions are included with optimized versions where applicable.
- VS Code settings are kept in `.vscode` folder for convenience.
- Executable files (`.exe`) are excluded from the repository.

## Purpose
- Track my learning progress in C++ and DSA.
- Maintain a backup of all practice files.
- Practice version control with Git and GitHub.
