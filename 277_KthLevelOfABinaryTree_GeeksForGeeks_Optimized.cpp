Problem: Print All Nodes at Kth Level of Binary Tree

Given a binary tree and an integer K, return all the nodes present at the Kth level of the binary tree from left to right.

- The root node is considered at level 1.
- Nodes at level K should be returned in left-to-right order as they appear in the tree.

Example 1:
        1
       / \
      2   3
       \
        4
         \
          5

K = 3
Output: 4

Explanation:
- Level 1: 1
- Level 2: 2 3
- Level 3: 4 (only one node at this level)

Example 2:
        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \
    4   5

K = 2
Output: 2 3

Explanation:
- Level 1: 1
- Level 2: 2 3
- Level 3: 4 5 (not included because K=2)

Approach Used:
- DFS (Depth First Search) recursion to track the current level.
- Base case stops recursion if the current node is NULL.
- When current level == K, push node's value to the result vector.

Time Complexity:
- O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited once.

Space Complexity:
- O(H), where H is the height of the tree due to recursion stack.
- O(N) in worst case for skewed tree.

Is it the most optimal?
- ✅ Acceptable for recursion-based approach.
- ✅ BFS level-order traversal could also be used iteratively and is similarly efficient.

Will it be accepted by online platforms?
- ✅ Yes, it won't cause MLE or TLE for standard constraints.

        // Recursive call to right subtree with level incremented by 1
        helper(root->right, ans, k, level+1);

/*
Logic Explanation:

1. Base condition:
   - If the current node is NULL, we stop recursion.
   - This prevents runtime errors and ensures we don't traverse beyond leaves.

2. Checking level:
   - If current level equals K, we add the node to result.
   - We return immediately to avoid unnecessary recursion beyond the kth level.

3. Recursive calls:
   - Traverse left subtree first, then right subtree.
   - Increment current level by 1 in recursive calls to track depth.

4. Why DFS works:
   - DFS ensures we visit nodes depth-wise.
   - Left-to-right order is maintained because left recursion happens before right recursion.

5. Why recursion stack is enough:
   - We only need to track the current level and node.
   - No extra data structures are required unlike BFS.

6. Base of recursion guarantees safety:
   - Stops at NULL nodes.
   - Stops adding nodes once we reach kth level for each branch.

Important Details, Warnings, and Key Insights:

✔ Base case is critical: if(!root) return; prevents crashes and unnecessary recursion.
✔ Use 'level' parameter to track depth; starts at 1 if root is considered level 1.
✔ DFS recursion ensures left-to-right order automatically due to call sequence.
✔ Pushing nodes at level == k ensures correctness and stops recursion further.
✔ BFS can be used for iterative solution with queue for similar results.

Warnings:
❌ Forgetting NULL check will cause runtime errors.
❌ Forgetting return after pushing node at kth level will traverse deeper unnecessarily.

Similar Questions and Approaches:
✔ Level Order Traversal – prints all nodes level by level.
✔ Right View / Left View of Binary Tree – only certain nodes at each level.
✔ Nodes at K Distance from Target Node – requires additional tracking.

Approach Variations:
✔ DFS recursion (as above) – simple and elegant.
✔ BFS iterative using queue – avoids recursion stack, useful for very deep trees.
