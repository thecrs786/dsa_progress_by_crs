// Shallow Copy vs Deep Copy

/* A shallow copy of an object copies all of the member values from
   one object to another. For example, Teacher t2(t1) and the default copy constructor
   create a shallow copy of t1 into t2. 
   If the members are value types (like int, double, std::string), the objects behave independently. 
   If the members are pointers, both objects share the same memory.

   A deep copy, on the other hand, not only copies the member values but also
   make copies of any dynamically allocated memory that the member points to.

/*| Copy type             | our code (`std::string`)  | Members are pointers                         |
  | --------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
  | our copy constructor  | behaves deep              | would be shallow unless manually deep copied |
  | Default compiler copy | behaves deep              | shallow â†’ same memory shared                 |

/* Normally when we use int x =5, the memory is allocated at the compile time
   but when we use int *p = new int(5), the memory is allocated at the runtime
   and we need to free it using delete p;

   If we have a class with a pointer member, and we use the default copy constructor,
   both objects will point to the same memory location. So, if we modify one object,
   the other object will also be affected. This is called shallow copy.

   To avoid this, we need to define our own copy constructor that performs a deep copy.
   In deep copy, we allocate new memory for the pointer member and copy the value
   from the original object to the new memory location.
    This way, both objects will have their own copies of the pointer member,
