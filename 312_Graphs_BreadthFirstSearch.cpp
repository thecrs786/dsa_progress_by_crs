GRAPH BASICS:

A graph G = (V, E) consists of:
- V: Set of vertices (nodes)
- E: Set of edges (connections between nodes)

Types of graphs:
1. Directed Graph (Digraph): edges have direction u -> v
2. Undirected Graph: edges have no direction u - v
3. Weighted Graph: edges carry a weight (distance, cost, etc.)
4. Unweighted Graph: edges have no weight
5. Cyclic / Acyclic: cycles exist or not
6. Sparse / Dense: few edges or many edges relative to nodes

Representation of Graphs:
1. Adjacency Matrix: 2D array VxV
   - Easy to check if edge exists
   - Takes O(V^2) space
   - Best for dense graphs
2. Adjacency List: Array/List of lists
   - Each vertex stores list of neighbors
   - Takes O(V + E) space
   - Best for sparse graphs
   - Can use vector<list<int>> or list<int>* dynamically

    BREADTH-FIRST SEARCH (BFS)

    - BFS is a graph traversal algorithm that explores vertices level by level.
      It visits all neighbors of a node before moving to the next level neighbors.
    - BFS uses a queue to maintain the order of traversal.
    - Characteristics:
        - Explores neighbors first, then neighbors of neighbors.
        - Time Complexity: O(V + E)
        - Space Complexity: O(V) for visited array + O(V) for queue in worst case
        - Works for both connected and disconnected graphs.
        - Commonly used in:
            - Finding shortest path in unweighted graphs
            - Checking connectivity
            - Level-order traversal in trees
            - Detecting bipartiteness

    BFS Traversal (handling disconnected components): 0 1 2 3 4 5 6

    Explanation of BFS Traversal:
    - Start from 0 → visit neighbors 1 → visit neighbors of 1 → 2 and 3
    - All vertices of first component are visited (0,1,2,3)
    - Move to 4 (unvisited) → visit 5
    - Move to 6 (isolated) → visit it
    - BFS ensures all nodes are visited even if graph is disconnected.
    - The traversal visits nodes in levels:
        Level 0: 0
        Level 1: 1
        Level 2: 2, 3
        Level 3: 4, 5
        Level 4: 6 (isolated)
