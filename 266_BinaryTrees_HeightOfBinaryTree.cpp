========================
EXPLANATION
========================
✔ This program builds a binary tree using a preorder sequence where -1 denotes NULL nodes.
✔ It then computes the height of the tree using a recursive approach.

✔ Height of a tree is defined as the number of nodes on the longest path from the root node to a leaf node.
✔ For example, a tree with only one node has a height of 1.

========================
BUILD TREE LOGIC
========================
✔ We use a static index 'idx' to keep track of where we are in the input sequence.
✔ Each call to buildTree increments 'idx' to pick the next element.
✔ When we encounter -1, it means that node is NULL and we backtrack to the previous node.
✔ This way, the recursive function builds the entire tree correctly.

========================
HEIGHT FUNCTION LOGIC
========================
✔ Base case: If the node is NULL, its height is 0.
✔ Recursive case:
   - We compute the height of the left subtree.
   - We compute the height of the right subtree.
   - The height of the current node is the maximum of left and right subtree heights plus 1.

✔ max(leftht, rightht) chooses the taller subtree at each step, building up the correct height.

========================
EXAMPLE
========================
Given input sequence:
1, 2, -1, -1, 3, 4, -1, -1, 5, -1, -1

The constructed tree looks like:
        1
      /   \
     2     3
          / \
         4   5

The height is 3 because the longest path from root (1) to leaf (4 or 5) is 3 nodes.

========================
IMPORTANT DETAILS
========================
✔ The height is computed using recursion, which makes the code elegant and simple.
✔ The base case ensures that the recursion terminates.
✔ The max function is used to compare subtree heights.

========================
WHY USE RECURSION?
========================
✔ Recursion helps in breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems.
✔ It naturally fits tree traversal and calculation problems.
✔ Each subtree is handled independently, making the logic easy to implement.

========================
SIMILAR PROBLEMS
========================
✔ Finding diameter of a tree.
✔ Checking if a tree is balanced.
✔ Computing sum of all nodes.
✔ Finding maximum or minimum node value.

========================
PRACTICE TIP
========================
✔ Practice building trees from different traversal orders (preorder, inorder, postorder).
✔ Try finding height iteratively as a challenge.
✔ Combine height logic with other problems like finding diameter or path sums.
