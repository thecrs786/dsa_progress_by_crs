LeetCode Problem 114 - Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List

Question (in brief):
Given the root of a binary tree, flatten it into a "linked list" in-place following preorder traversal.
- The left child of each node should be set to NULL.
- The right child should point to the next node in preorder.

Example 1:
Input: root = [1,2,5,3,4,null,6]
Output: [1,null,2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]
Explanation:
The preorder traversal is 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6.
The left pointers are set to NULL and right pointers form the sequence.

Example 2:
Input: root = []
Output: []
Explanation: An empty tree returns an empty output.

Example 3:
Input: root = [0]
Output: [0]
Explanation: A single node tree is already flattened.

Approach Used:
✔ Recursive approach where we flatten left and right subtrees separately and attach them in the correct order.
✔ We temporarily store the right subtree before modifying pointers, process the left subtree, and then append the saved right subtree at the end of the flattened left subtree.

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes. Each node is processed once.
Space Complexity: O(h), where h is the height of the tree, due to recursion stack space.

Is this the most optimal solution?
✔ It is optimized in time (O(n)) and clarity.
✘ It is not optimized in space — recursion uses O(h) extra space.
✔ For problems without strict space constraints, this solution is widely acceptable.
✔ The Morris iterative solution achieves O(1) space, but is more complex.

Will it be accepted by LeetCode?
✔ Yes, it passes all test cases without causing MLE (memory limit exceeded) or TLE (time limit exceeded), unless the tree is extremely deep.

Similar questions and approaches:
✔ 145. Binary Tree Postorder Traversal → recursion and iteration both used.
✔ 144. Binary Tree Preorder Traversal → similar approach for visiting nodes.
✔ 98. Validate Binary Search Tree → recursion helps traverse in order.
✔ 102. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal → uses BFS instead of DFS.
✔ 117. Populating Next Right Pointers → recursion helps traverse tree layers.

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;

    TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}

        if(root->left != nullptr){
            // Save the original right subtree
            TreeNode* temp = root->right;

            // Recursively flatten the left subtree
            flatten(root->left);

            // Move the flattened left subtree to the right of the current node
            root->right = root->left;
            root->left = nullptr; // Set left child to NULL as per problem requirement

            // Find the last node in the new right subtree
            TreeNode* curr = root->right;
            while(curr->right != nullptr){
                curr = curr->right;
            }
            // Attach the saved original right subtree to the end
            curr->right = temp;
        }

        // Step 2: Continue flattening the right subtree
        flatten(root->right);
    }

/*
LOGIC AND EXPLANATION (Fully detailed):

1. The problem asks to flatten the tree using preorder traversal → root → left → right.
2. For every node:
   - We need to flatten its left subtree and attach it to the right.
   - The original right subtree needs to be appended at the end of this flattened left subtree.
3. To ensure we don’t lose the original right subtree, we save it temporarily before modifying the tree structure.
4. The process involves:
   CASE 1 → If the left subtree is not null:
     - Save the right subtree
     - Flatten the left subtree recursively
     - Attach the flattened left subtree to the right of the node
     - Set the left pointer to NULL
     - Find the last node of this flattened subtree
     - Attach the original right subtree at the end
   CASE 2 → Whether or not there was a left subtree, always flatten the right subtree recursively.
5. The recursion unwinds only after processing left and right subtrees at each step, ensuring preorder order is preserved.

HOW RECURSION LINKS IN EACH CASE:
✔ At each node, recursion first ensures the left subtree is fully flattened before moving to the right subtree.
✔ After flattening left, it temporarily holds the original right subtree and reattaches it at the correct position.
✔ The recursive stack automatically preserves context as we go deeper into the tree.

EDGE CASES HANDLED:
✔ If the node is NULL → return immediately.
✔ If the left subtree is NULL → skip flattening and move to the right subtree.
✔ If the right subtree is NULL → no need to reattach anything; process left and continue.

HOW IT FLATTENS THE TREE:
✔ It rearranges pointers such that the left subtree is shifted to the right and the original right subtree is attached at the end.
✔ This mimics preorder traversal order.

HOW NULL CASES ARE HANDLED:
✔ Base case stops recursion when a node is NULL.
✔ Left pointers are explicitly set to NULL as required.
✔ Traversal ensures nodes are processed only if they exist.

WORKING EXAMPLE
*/

int main() {
    // Create the binary tree:
    //      1
    //     / \
    //    2   5
    //   / \   \
    //  3   4   6

    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1,
                        new TreeNode(2,
                            new TreeNode(3),
                            new TreeNode(4)),
                        new TreeNode(5,
                            nullptr,
                            new TreeNode(6)));

    Solution solution;
    solution.flatten(root);

    // Output the flattened tree as a sequence by traversing right pointers
    TreeNode* curr = root;
    cout << "Flattened tree: ";
    while(curr != nullptr){
        cout << curr->val << " ";
        curr = curr->right;
    }
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}

IMPORTANT DETAILS, WARNINGS, AND KEY INSIGHTS:

✔ Always save the right subtree before modifying the current node’s pointers.
✔ After flattening the left subtree, attach it to the right and set the left to NULL.
✔ Traverse to the end of the newly flattened subtree to append the original right subtree.
✔ Recursion depth depends on the tree height → use caution in very deep trees.

⚠ Common mistakes:
- Forgetting to set left to NULL → violates problem constraints.
- Not reattaching the original right subtree → causes data loss.
- Incorrect traversal of the rightmost node → incorrect tree structure.

✔ Recursion works because the call stack retains the state at each level.
✔ The preorder traversal order is preserved by processing left before right.
✔ Edge cases like empty trees or single-node trees are handled gracefully.

SIMILAR QUESTIONS AND APPROACHES:
✔ 145. Binary Tree Postorder Traversal → recursion helps process left and right before visiting.
✔ 144. Binary Tree Preorder Traversal → similar recursion but without needing to rearrange pointers.
✔ 98. Validate Binary Search Tree → recursion and inorder traversal to check sorted order.
✔ 102. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal → BFS approach using queues.
✔ 117. Populating Next Right Pointers → recursion or level-order traversal for tree layering.

MASTERING RECURSION:
✔ Practice with small trees and manually trace the recursion stack.
✔ Diagram each step to visualize how pointers are changed.
✔ Learn to distinguish between temporary and permanent modifications.
✔ Understand that recursion is powerful but requires careful state management.
