GRAPH BASICS:

A graph G = (V, E) consists of:
- V: Set of vertices (nodes)
- E: Set of edges (connections between nodes)

Types of graphs:
1. Directed Graph (Digraph): edges have direction u -> v
2. Undirected Graph: edges have no direction u - v
3. Weighted Graph: edges carry a weight (distance, cost, etc.)
4. Unweighted Graph: edges have no weight
5. Cyclic / Acyclic: cycles exist or not
6. Sparse / Dense: few edges or many edges relative to nodes

Representation of Graphs:
1. Adjacency Matrix: 2D array VxV
   - Easy to check if edge exists
   - Takes O(V^2) space
   - Best for dense graphs
2. Adjacency List: Array/List of lists
   - Each vertex stores list of neighbors
   - Takes O(V + E) space
   - Best for sparse graphs
   - Can use vector<list<int>> or list<int>* dynamically
*/

class Graph {
    int V;              // Number of vertices
    list<int>* l;       // Dynamic array of doubly linked lists to store adjacency lists
                        // Why list? Doubly linked list allows efficient insertion/deletion
                        // Why dynamic array? V can be decided at runtime, not compile time

        this->V = V;
        /*
        Allocate memory dynamically:
        l = new list<int>[V] creates an array of V lists (adjacency lists)

        l[u].push_back(v); // Add v to u's adjacency list
        l[v].push_back(u); // Add u to v's adjacency list (because undirected graph)
        /*
        For weighted graph: use pair<int,int> (neighbor, weight)
        Example: list<pair<int,int>> *l; l[u].push_back({v, weight});

    /*
    Additional Methods we can implement using adjacency list:

    1. BFS (Breadth-First Search)
    2. DFS (Depth-First Search)
    3. Detect cycles
    4. Find shortest path (Dijkstra for weighted, BFS for unweighted)
    5. Check connectivity (connected components)
    6. Minimum Spanning Tree (Prim's or Kruskal's)

    Adjacency List Representation:
    0 : 1
    1 : 0 2 3
    2 : 1 3 4
    3 : 1 2
    4 : 2

    Explanation:
    - Vertex 0 connected to 1
    - Vertex 1 connected to 0, 2, 3
    - Vertex 2 connected to 1, 3, 4
    - Vertex 3 connected to 1, 2
    - Vertex 4 connected to 2

    Key Points:
    - Undirected graph: edges go both ways
    - Unweighted graph: no weights are stored
    - Efficient storage using adjacency list (O(V + E) space)
    - Using list allows fast insertions
    - Using dynamic array allows runtime flexibility for V
