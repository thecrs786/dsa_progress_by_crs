// ABSTRACTION IN C++ - 10/10 EXAMPLE

/*
Abstraction: Hiding implementation details and showing only essential features.
- Implemented using access specifiers (public, private, protected).
- Abstract classes define "what to do" but not "how to do it".
- Encapsulation is the data hiding part of abstraction.
- Abstract classes cannot be instantiated; they are meant to be inherited.

/*
Key Points & Insights:
1. Pure virtual function (`= 0`) is what makes a class abstract.
2. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated directly.
3. Abstract classes can contain multiple pure virtual functions.
4. Derived classes MUST override all pure virtual functions to become concrete (instantiable).
5. Use base class pointers/references to achieve runtime polymorphism (dynamic binding).
6. Virtual destructors are important to safely delete derived objects via base pointers.
7. Abstract classes act as interfaces or blueprints for derived classes.
8. You can mix abstract and non-abstract functions in the same class.
9. Multiple abstract classes can be inherited (interface-like multiple inheritance).
10. Abstraction improves code reusability, flexibility, and maintainability.
