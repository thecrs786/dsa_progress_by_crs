// Inheritance

/* Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class (derived class) 
inherits properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) from an 
existing class (base class). 
This promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.

// Flow of constructor calls in inheritance:

// 1. When creating a derived class object (Student s2):
//      a) Base class constructor (Person) is called first.
//         - Ensures all base class members are initialized properly.
//         - If base has only parameterized constructors, you must call one explicitly.
//      b) Then derived class constructor (Student) executes.
//         - Initializes derived class members (e.g., rollNo).

// 2. If the base class has a default constructor:
//      - Derived class can call it automatically if no initializer list is provided.
//      - You can still use an initializer list to call a parameterized base constructor.

// 3. If the base class has no default constructor:
//      - Every derived class constructor must call a base class constructor explicitly using initializer list.
//      - Otherwise, compilation will fail.

// 4. Member initialization order:
//      - Base class members initialized first, in the order they are declared.
//      - Derived class members initialized next, in the order they are declared in the derived class.

// 5. Why initializer list is preferred:
//      - Directly initializes members instead of assigning values inside constructor body.
//      - More efficient, especially for const members, references, or classes without default constructor.
